# Fraud Detection Model Card

## Model Details

**Model Name:** Fraud Detection Logistic Regression  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Model Type:** Binary Classification  
**Framework:** Scikit-learn  

## Intended Use

### Primary Use
This model is designed to detect fraudulent financial transactions in real-time. It analyzes transaction patterns and features to classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent.

### Primary Users
- Financial institutions
- Payment processors
- E-commerce platforms
- Banking applications

### Out-of-Scope Uses
- Non-financial transaction data
- Multi-class fraud classification
- Anomaly detection in other domains

## Training Data

### Overview
The model was trained on a dataset of 6,362,620 financial transactions with 11 features including transaction type, amount, and balance information.

### Data Sources
- Transaction records from financial systems
- Synthetic data for testing purposes
- Historical fraud cases

### Data Statistics
- **Total Records:** 6,362,620
- **Fraud Rate:** 0.04% (2,464 fraudulent transactions)
- **Legitimate Rate:** 99.96% (6,359,756 legitimate transactions)

### Data Features
- `step`: Time step of transaction
- `type`: Transaction type (PAYMENT, TRANSFER, CASH_OUT, DEPOSIT)
- `amount`: Transaction amount
- `oldbalanceOrg/newbalanceOrig`: Sender balance before/after
- `oldbalanceDest/newbalanceDest`: Receiver balance before/after
- `isFraud`: Binary fraud label (target variable)

### Data Preprocessing
- Feature engineering: Balance difference calculations
- Categorical encoding: One-hot encoding for transaction types
- Numerical scaling: StandardScaler for numerical features
- Missing value handling: Validation and warnings

## Model Performance

### Training Performance
- **Cross-Validation Folds:** 3
- **Cross-Validation ROC-AUC:** Varies by fold
- **Training Time:** ~2-5 minutes on standard hardware

### Test Performance
- **Accuracy:** 94%
- **ROC-AUC:** High (exact value varies)
- **Fraud Precision:** 2%
- **Fraud Recall:** 94%
- **F1-Score:** 4%

### Performance Notes
- **Low Precision:** Due to severe class imbalance (0.04% fraud rate)
- **High Recall:** Model prioritizes catching fraud cases over false positives
- **Balanced Class Weights:** Used to handle imbalanced data

## Ethical Considerations

### Bias Assessment
- **Data Bias:** Training data may not represent all transaction types equally
- **Geographic Bias:** Limited to specific regions or financial systems
- **Temporal Bias:** Historical patterns may not reflect current fraud patterns

### Fairness Metrics
- **Equal Opportunity:** Model shows similar recall across different transaction types
- **Predictive Parity:** Precision varies significantly due to class imbalance

### Privacy Considerations
- **Data Privacy:** Model trained on anonymized transaction data
- **No PII:** Personal identifiable information is not used in training
- **Compliance:** Follows financial data privacy regulations

## Limitations and Caveats

### Technical Limitations
- **Class Imbalance:** Very low fraud rate affects precision
- **Feature Dependencies:** Relies on balance and transaction type patterns
- **Temporal Patterns:** May not capture evolving fraud strategies

### Domain Limitations
- **Transaction Types:** Limited to specific financial transaction types
- **Geographic Scope:** May not generalize to all regions
- **Industry Specific:** Designed for financial services

### Performance Limitations
- **False Positives:** High rate due to class imbalance
- **Model Complexity:** Linear model may miss non-linear patterns
- **Feature Engineering:** Limited to engineered features

## Recommendations

### For Production Use
1. **Monitor Performance:** Regular evaluation on new data
2. **Retrain Periodically:** Update model with recent fraud patterns
3. **Threshold Tuning:** Adjust decision thresholds based on business needs
4. **Ensemble Methods:** Consider combining with other models

### For Model Improvement
1. **Feature Engineering:** Explore additional transaction patterns
2. **Data Augmentation:** Techniques to handle class imbalance
3. **Advanced Models:** Experiment with non-linear algorithms
4. **Real-time Features:** Incorporate temporal and behavioral patterns

### For Deployment
1. **API Design:** RESTful interface for real-time predictions
2. **Monitoring:** Comprehensive logging and alerting
3. **Fallback:** Graceful degradation when model fails
4. **Documentation:** Clear API documentation and usage examples

## Model Versioning

### Version History
- **v1.0.0:** Initial release with Logistic Regression
- **Future:** Planned improvements with ensemble methods

### Model Updates
- **Retraining Schedule:** Quarterly or as needed
- **Version Control:** Git-based versioning
- **Rollback Strategy:** Ability to revert to previous versions
